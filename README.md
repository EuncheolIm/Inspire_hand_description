# Inspire hand RH56DFTP-2L

> Note: The MuJoCo XML files in this repository are customized versions created from URDF sources.

This project provides a MuJoCo simulation for the `Inspire hand RH56DFTP-2L` model.

## Overview
- Includes Inspire Hand model files (URDF/XML/OBJ) and an example control script.
- Mesh files are organized into separate `collision/` and `visual/` folders.
- The example script applies PD control to finger joints and runs a looping trajectory.

## Project Structure
- `Inspire_hand/`
  - `urdf/`: URDF source files
    - `inspire_hand_right.urdf`
  - `xml/`: MuJoCo XML files
    - `scene.xml`: Main simulation scene
    - `inspire_hand_right.xml`: Right-hand model definition
    - `inspire_hand_left.xml`: Left-hand model definition
  - `collision/`: Collision mesh OBJ files
  - `visual/`: Visual mesh OBJ files
  - `xml/material.mtl`: Material information
- `example/`
  - `control_inspire_hand.py`: MuJoCo viewer-based control example

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- MuJoCo Python package
- NumPy

## Installation
```bash
pip install mujoco numpy
```

## Run
From the project root, run the example with:

```bash
python example/control_inspire_hand.py
```

When executed, the viewer opens and finger joints move repeatedly within their configured ranges.

## Notes
- You can check the controlled joints in `ACTUATED_JOINTS` in `control_inspire_hand.py`.
- Control gains can be adjusted with `KP_SINGLE_HAND` and `KD_SINGLE_HAND`.
